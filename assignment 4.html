				<p> Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance 
					from various supporting characters, including his buttler Alfred,
					police commissioner Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin.
					Unlike most superheros, Batman does not posses any superpowers; 
					rather, he relies on his genius intellect, physical powers, martial 
					arts abilities, dectective skills, science and technology, vast wealth,
					intimidation, and indomitable will. A large assortment of villains 
					make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his archenemy, the Joker.</p>
